# stuff

Absolutely filthy and non-sensical repository of random code with (almost) no utility whatsoever. Use anything herein contained at your own expense. I do not care about code beauty, efficiency nor your own security. Deal with that on your own. But I do care about learning, so criticism is appreciated.

## Work*ing* `stuff`

1. [Snapshot Shield](https://github.com/wisewtf/stuff/tree/main/python/snapshot-shield) - Utility to warn about dangling snapshots in VMWare's VCSA environments.
2. [Get-AutoPilotHashes.ps1](https://github.com/wisewtf/stuff/blob/main/powershell/get-autopilot-hashes.ps1) - Script to gather local computers HW hashes for Intune Autopilot purposes.
3. [findmac](https://github.com/wisewtf/stuff/tree/main/crystal/findmac) - I mostly forgot what this does. It finds the vendor of a `mac address` using the APIs at macvendors.com.

## Work*ed-on* `stuff`

Currenctly working on: `torrent-remover` a Python script that deletes all qBittorrent torrents and its downloaded files when they have been active a set amount of seconds. This is because **I believe** (from my experience) the feature in qBittorrent that does this very job advertises it to the trackers and they throttle or deny your connection to them. Which makes sense, sharing is caring. I do not care.
